# Sudoku-Solver
This repository contains a downloadable (in-progress) application for solvable Sudoku puzzle challenges.

## Background

Originally a class assignment designed to solve predefined Sudoku challenges as a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), this application has been transformed into a GUI designed for the enjoyment of others. The algorithm used to solve a given Sudoku board is called "backtracking" (see SudokuPuzzleSolver.py).

In Artifical Intellgence, "backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking

The implemented algorithm's accuracy has been verified by comparing its outputted solutions to various Sudoku solvers found online.

## Description

Puzzles included are those varying in difficulty provided by the professor as well as randomly generated ones. Click a tile to cycle through numbers 1-9. Right-click the same tile to cycle backwards.

**TL;DR:**
* A Sudoku board consists of 9x9 tiles
* All numbers in each row must be unique
* All numbers in each column must be unique
* Diagnal numbers can be identical
